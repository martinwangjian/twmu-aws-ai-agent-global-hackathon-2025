## Quick Tips

**Voice**:
- Speak as if explaining to a colleague
- Show excitement about innovations
- Don't apologize for AWS issues - just state facts

**Pacing**:
- Slower is better than faster
- Pause to let viewers absorb screenshots
- Don't rush through A2A flow (it's your differentiator)

**Emphasis**:
- "AgentCore Memory with semantic search" (not just chat history)
- "Agent-to-agent communication" (autonomous discovery)
- "Human-in-the-loop" (for payment approval)
- "99% cost reduction" (business impact)

**Time Management**:
- If running long, cut intro/closing, not technical content
- A2A flow is your strongest differentiator - don't rush it
- Architecture overview can be 45s instead of 1m if needed

Good luck! ðŸŽ¬
