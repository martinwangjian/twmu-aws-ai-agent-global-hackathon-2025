# ADR-004: AP2 Payment Protocol Should Be A2A Only, Not WhatsApp Path

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Context**: Hackathon feature implementation - AP2 + x402 mock payment integration

---

## Decision

**AP2 (Agent Payment Protocol) with x402 stablecoin payments should ONLY be implemented in the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) path, NOT in the WhatsApp (human-to-agent) path.**

## Context

During implementation of mock payment feature for hackathon, we initially started integrating payment tools into `agentcore_mcp_agent.py` (WhatsApp agent). However, this is architecturally incorrect.

### Key Insight

**AP2 is an agent-native protocol designed for agent-to-agent communication, not human-to-agent.**

## Architecture

### ❌ INCORRECT (What We Almost Did)

```
WhatsApp User → WhatsApp Agent → AP2 Payment Tools
```

This mixes human-to-agent and agent-to-agent protocols.

### ✅ CORRECT (What We Should Do)

```
WhatsApp User → WhatsApp Agent (human-to-agent)
                      ↓
                [A2A Protocol]
                      ↓
            Payment Agent (A2A server)
                      ↓
            AP2 + x402 Payment Processing
```

## Rationale

1. **Protocol Separation**
   - WhatsApp path = Human-to-Agent communication
   - A2A path = Agent-to-Agent communication
   - AP2 = Agent Payment Protocol (agent-to-agent by design)

2. **Architectural Clarity**
   - Keeps concerns separated
   - WhatsApp agent focuses on booking logic
   - Payment agent focuses on payment processing
   - Demonstrates proper microservices architecture

3. **Hackathon Value**
   - Shows understanding of A2A protocol
   - Demonstrates agent orchestration
   - Highlights agent-native payment rails
   - Better story: "Agents delegating to specialized agents"

4. **Future Extensibility**
   - Payment agent can be called by multiple agents
   - Easy to add other payment methods
   - Can scale independently

## Implementation

### Files Created

- `src/agents/tools/payment_tool.py` - Payment tools (request_payment, check_payment_status, cancel_payment, approve_payment)
- Uses S3 for payment tracking
- **Human-in-the-loop approval** via Claude Desktop MCP tool

### Where Payment Tools Should Be Used

**✅ Integrate into**: `src/agents/agentcore_a2a_server.py`

- Add payment tools to A2A server's tool list
- Update A2A server system prompt with payment instructions

### Human-in-the-Loop Approval (Updated 2025-10-18)

**Decision**: Payments require explicit human approval, NOT auto-confirmation.

**Architecture**:

```
Claude Desktop (Human)
    ↓ MCP Tool: approve_payment(booking_id)
MCP A2A Orchestrator (mcp_server/a2a_orchestrator_mcp.py)
    ↓ A2A Protocol + Bearer Token
AgentCore A2A Server (src/agents/agentcore_a2a_server.py)
    ↓ approve_payment tool
S3 Storage (payment status: confirmed)
```

**Flow**:

1. Human: "Book for 6 people tomorrow at 7pm"
2. Agent: Creates booking + requests payment ($120 USDC)
3. Agent: Returns payment details with booking_id
4. Human: Calls `approve_payment(booking_id="abc123")` via MCP
5. Agent: Updates payment status to "confirmed"
6. Agent: Confirms booking completion

**Benefits**:

- Demonstrates responsible AI with human oversight
- Interactive demo for hackathon judges
- Real-world payment approval workflow
- Unique differentiator vs other teams

**See**: `docs/planning/AP2_HUMAN_IN_LOOP_PLAN.md`

- Demonstrate agent-to-agent payment delegation

**❌ Do NOT integrate into**: `src/agents/agentcore_mcp_agent.py`

- WhatsApp agent should NOT have direct payment tools
- Keep WhatsApp agent focused on booking logic
- If payment needed, WhatsApp agent should call A2A payment agent

## Consequences

### Positive

- ✅ Architecturally correct separation of concerns
- ✅ Demonstrates true A2A protocol usage
- ✅ Better hackathon story and differentiation
- ✅ More scalable and maintainable
- ✅ Shows understanding of agent-native protocols

### Negative

- ⚠️ Slightly more complex to demo (requires A2A setup)
- ⚠️ May need to explain architecture to judges
- ⚠️ Cannot demo payment directly via WhatsApp (by design)

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Payment in WhatsApp Agent

**Rejected** - Mixes human-to-agent and agent-to-agent protocols. Architecturally incorrect.

### Alternative 2: Payment in Both Paths

**Rejected** - Code duplication, unclear separation of concerns.

### Alternative 3: No Payment Feature

**Rejected** - Loses unique differentiator and innovation points.

## Demo Strategy

For hackathon demo:

1. **Show A2A Payment Agent** (primary demo)
   - Demonstrate agent-to-agent payment via A2A protocol
   - Highlight AP2 + x402 stablecoin integration
   - Show payment tracking and confirmation

2. **Document in README**
   - Explain architecture decision
   - Show comparison: AP2 vs traditional payments
   - Highlight agent-native payment rails

3. **Video Demo**
   - Explain why AP2 is agent-to-agent
   - Show payment agent responding to A2A requests
   - Emphasize innovation and future of agent commerce

- WhatsApp agent: `src/agents/agentcore_mcp_agent.py`
- Planning doc: `docs/planning/AP2_PAYMENT_DOD.md`

## Notes

- Payment tools are complete and tested
- Integration into A2A server is pending
- WhatsApp agent remains unchanged (correct)
- This decision aligns with hackathon's focus on A2A protocol
